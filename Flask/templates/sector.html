                                Technology: At the forefront of innovation and at the center of the Information Age,
                                this sector is sure to continue to outperform for decades. The technology sector is a category of stocks that
                                contains technological businesses, such as manufacturers producing computer hardware,
                                computer software or electronics and technological service industry companies, such as those
                                providing information technology and business data processing. While some examples of technology
                                companies could include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) these stocks are not included here.
                                This sector is strong with other tech companies are sure to come along with new innovations we are not thinking
                                about today and is highly investable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Healthcare: With an aging population and rapid advances in biotechnology, the health industry is sure to
                                thrive in the years and decades ahead. The healthcare sector is quite broad. Even a person
                                with no investing experience can think of some specific area of the health industry, such as
                                hospital conglomerates, institutional services, insurance companies, drug manufacturers,
                                biomedical companies, or medical instrument makers. Also, when many industries are doing poorly
                                due to negative economic conditions, the health industry can still perform relatively well
                                because people still need to see the doctor and buy their drugs, regardless of
                                economic conditions. For this reason, the healthcare sector is considered a "defensive sector."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Consumer Staples: This sector is typically viewed as a safe haven during periods of market
                                volatility or economic downturn, and have benefited from increases in volatility in the
                                overall market. Staples companies also likely have benefited in recent years from effective
                                cost-cutting and increased trade concerns. Further, as geopolitical and domestic political
                                tensions rise, investors typically become a bit more nervous, and may seek short-term shelter in the staples sector.
                                Lastly, the moderation in oil prices could result in less money being spent on energy costs
                                and more available for other spending keeping this sector robust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
								Consumer Discretionary: Basically, any goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers,
                                but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Bottom line is that lower unemployment means
                                you've got more consumers who have the ability to spend. And since wage growth is only growing modestly year over year,
                                you would want to buy assets when there's the potential for a catalyst.

                                Energy: Most people see don’t see this sector as anything more than just oil. While the biggest factor impacting the entire energy sector right now is oil prices, what’s often overlooked is the energy sector also includes oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids pipelines and other types of assets. These are steady, fee-based driven assets that are somewhat agnostic to oil and natural gas prices; these subsectors derive their cash flow, revenues and growth primarily from volumes. While the aforementioned subsectors would be the most robust, energy headwinds such as: U.S. oil production is increasing, continual battles for global market share ever change geopolitical landscape keep outlook returns for this sector modest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Financials: It may seem that economic fundamentals are strong, the regulatory climate is favorable and possibly getting better (i.e. Volcker Rule), and transformation technologies are more readily accessible, powerful, and economical than ever before, but the headwinds facing the sector are strong. Some headwinds include low interest rates and a flat(tening) yield curve, leading to slim interest margins, which make up a big part of a bank's earnings. Throw in slumping merger-and-acquisition activity, underreserved loans to the energy sector (another sector with low prospects), higher capital reserve requirements and weaker trading revenue and it adds up to declining return on equity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Industrials: When Energy is cheap Industrials generally benefit with cheap feedstocks. And while real estate's record-strong fundamentals remain in place, the sector sees headwinds including labor shortages and tariff issues, and impacts from the shift in manufacturing from China to the U.S. or emerging exporters including Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh and western hemisphere countries like Brazil and Mexico could shift demand to regions of the country better suited to logistically handle these products. These issues cause the industry become tighter leaving only cost cutting strategies to turn profits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
								Materials: Similar to Industrials, the materials sector has struggled in the past due to global growth issues combined with trade dispute worries all working to undermine performance during many periods. Likewise, we see reduction in demand from China, larger inventories in China continuing to build, increased labor costs, and general trade concerns depressing the performance outlook for this sector.
